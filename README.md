# Bowling Score Calculator

This project simulates scoring for a single-player game of bowling.

The bowling display, inputs, and core data models are written in jQuery. Frame data is sent to a remote API for score calculations, and returned to the interface asynchronously.  

The backend application is a Flask API written in Python running on a CentOS server.
